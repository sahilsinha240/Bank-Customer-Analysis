# Bank-Customer-Analysis
The tableau dashboard I have created allows for effective bank data analysis. All customer detail can be thoroughly analyzed, allowing for insight into customer behaviour, preferences and other trends that could prove beneficial to the bank. This dashboard is a comprehensive tool which can help the bank to further understand their customers and make potential improvements to their services. Through this dashboard, the bank can build more meaningful relationships with their customers, creating a positive and lasting experience.
